##Reading Response to Seeing Like a State and Cambridge Analytica##

James Scott mentioned a combination of four elements that would finally lead to the tragedy of social engineering. One of the four elements is the high modernism, which he argued as a kind of ideology which is simple and shallow. From my understanding, high modernism is aiming at simplifying and integrating the administrative way. Scott mentioned that “high modernism must not be confused with scientific practice” (“Seeing Like a State”). He believes it is an absurd ideology instead of a practical way. But I believe it can be found in both ways. Taking the Great Leap Forward in China from 1958 to 1960 as an example, both the ideology and the methodology were simplified. People believed that it is efficient and right to seek quick success and instant benefit, and they actually followed this belief, which finally turned out to be a tragedy.

In terms of data and privacy, something similar can be found. The Facebook data exploitation for political use is a kind of simplification, as the politicians use data and technology as a way to cheat. The improper use of private information is a kind of high modernism. The technology is improving and developing continuously, and people take it as granted to believe that this is a signal of modernization. We are, on the other hand, simplifying our view towards the development of data. In many cases normal people just give their data to the society vulnerably without knowing where these data will go to. We are doing the similar thing as what happened during the Great Leap Forward: we naturally believe that it is good to utilize the development of technology and enjoy the convenience from it.

What is more, people might never know who is actually monitoring them, which is horrible to think it further. In the case of Facebook, it seems that Cambridge Analytica is the one that should be blamed for, as they claimed that the data would be only used for academic uses. This becomes a kind of “big-brother” situation: you thought it was Facebook that was watching you, but actually it is Cambridge, or might be someone else.
