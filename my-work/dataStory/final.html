        From Ann Hodges to the native American Clackamas tribe, meteorites
        are often considered to be mysterious. It takes thousands of years for
        a meteorite to travel through the space that we do not know much about
        and come to Earth.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We believe that a meteorite can bring us luck; we consider
        a meteorite as an omen. But the truth is that we are more likely to become
        Ann Hodges when encountering a meteorite, being so anxious because of getting a
        meteorite remain and becoming too famous due to the space rock. The additional
        meanings of a meteorite has added emotional burden to us.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This kind of emotional burden caused by meteorites is now being used as a commercial
        opportunity by some shops. They labeled a rock as a meteorite remain and
        sell it at a high price, advertising by claiming that the rock can have special
        power and provide luck and happiness.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        At the beginning of this project, I showed the objective process for a meteorite to come
        into being. Scienfitically speaking, there is no evidence that meteorites
        possess any superhuman powers. I hope that you can know more about the actual
        formation of a meteorite, be aware of the commercial frauds that might take the
        advantage of your misunderstanding, and appreciate more about the splendid natural phenomenon.
        They come from billions of years ago; they are the witnesses of the history of the universe.
        <br/>

        Thank you.
