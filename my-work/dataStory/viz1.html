          <br/>
          From Ann Hodges to the native American Clackamas tribe, meteorites
          are often considered to be mysterious. It takes thousands of years for
          a meteorite to travel through the space that we do not know much about
          and come to Earth.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          We believe that a meteorite can bring us luck; we consider
          a meteorite as an omen. But the truth is that we are more likely to become
          Ann Hodges when encountering a meteorite, being so anxious because of getting a
          meteorite remain and becoming too famous due to the space rock. The additional
          meanings of a meteorite has added emotional burden to us.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          This kind of emotional burden caused by meteorites is now being used as a commercial
          opportunity by some shops. They labeled a rock as a meteorite remain and
          sell it at a high price, advertising by claiming that the rock can have special
          power and provide luck and happiness.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          At the beginning of this project, I showed the objective process for a meteorite to come
          into being. Scienfitically speaking, there is no evidence that meteorites
          possess any superhuman powers. I hope that you can know more about the actual
          formation of a meteorite, be aware of the commercial frauds that might take the
          advantage of your misunderstanding, and appreciate more about the splendid natural phenomenon.
          They come from billions of years ago; they are the witnesses of the history of the universe.
