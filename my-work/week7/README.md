## Week 7 - Research for datasets

**1. [Meteorite Landings Data from NASA](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh)**

This is a dataset originally from the Meteoritical Society, but I found it on NASA's Open Data Portal. It contains information about all the known meteorite landings, including the name of the meteorites, the year they landed, the geolocation where they landed

For the visualization, I was thinking about presenting the information based on a geographical map and identifying different meteorites on different spots. Detailed information about each meteorite can be found when the cursor is hovering on the spots. Maybe also create several pages of map regarding different time scales.

**2. [Rap World Artists](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/rapworld/table/?location=4,27.87793,95.05371&basemap=jawg.streets)**

Contains information about 581 rappers/rap groups/other artists in the rap area, and had a visualization based on the where they grew up or the place that has significant impact to them.

For the visualization, I'll probably make it based on the time that an artist began to active in the field. For example, create several lines on the page, filter some data, and make each point on the lines represent one artist. I'm also thinking about creating a wavy interaction when hovering on the lines and a piece of song that the certain artist made can be played.

**3. [Economic Inequality by Gender](https://ourworldindata.org/economic-inequality-by-gender)**

This dataset shows the inequality gender gap ragarding how much male and female are paid and how the female economic status is in a country. It is worth noting that the inequality does not directly show the discrimination, as the cause of the gender gap not only literally contains gender, but factors like education, self-esteem may cause the gap as well. The dataset firstly shows the situation of the gender gap among different countries, the changing of the gap across the time, the situation of the gender gap among people with different ages, and the relationship between gender gap and the economic situation of a country. Then it focus on the information about women in senior positons and women paid low. The economic situation of the females in a country, such as whether they have autonomos to their savings, are also included in the dataset. In general, the dataset shows the economic inequality by gender from various angles, which contains abundent relevant information.

For the visualization, I might divide the page into two part: one represents male and another part is for female. As I found the situation is getting better (generally, might be wrong) from what the dataset shown, the evolution process as the time goes by may also be presented in the visualization.
