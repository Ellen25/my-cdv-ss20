## Response to "Surveillance Capitalism"

Generally speaking, my understanding of surveillance capitalism is a mechanism and dynamic that business corporation is using technology as a tool to monitor people’s behavior and use them for future prediction and profit making. The supply in this production chain is totally free, as the material comes from the cyber space. After collecting the behavioral data from private users online, companies or industries will make good use of them and produce them into what we now defined as high-tech or futuristic design, like AI or machine learning.

This makes me think of that in 2018, Mark Zuckerberg was sent to the congress, being accused that Facebook is monitoring its users’ information. Things also happen in our daily life. For instance, I have mentioned this example in previous responses that I always get calls from strangers who know all the information about myself and my family. Me and my friend often talked about that the recommendation from TaoBao might also be a kind of surveillance: I chat with my friend online, or sometimes even offline, face to face, and said that I really want to buy a jacket of a certain brand, for example, and the next day TaoBao will send me the link where I can get that jacket, which is surprising and horrifying.

In the video Shoshana and Naomi mentioned about the legislation towards the privacy policy, which reminds me of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe. GDPR aimed at offering the Internet users an opportunity to hold back their privacy autonomy; for instance, the right to deal with and delete one’s information. I personally want to question the effectiveness of any kinds of policies like GDPR. As Shoshana mentioned in the video, “you have nothing to hide and you have nothing”. We are so tiny being monitored.

The point for discussing this issue is never about abandoning technology, but more about the awareness. It is always important to be aware that we are currently under this kind of situation.
