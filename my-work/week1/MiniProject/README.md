## Coding Exercise: Google Form data and JS Visualization

I created a survey a bout the things that people might hate the most. Collected data from 15 persons, I gathered information about to what extent do they hate a certain thing (e.g. annoying child;people who post your worst picture to social media) by ranging level from 1 to 10. In additional to what we've learned in class, I also added the average number (getting 2 numbers after the point) to the innerHTML of the bars. I learned the whole process of collecting data and visualizing them. It is basic but helped me to reviewed a lot.
