## This is a README.md page

What's nice about files called "README.md" is that GitHub shows them as *front page* of a folder. Check out here what I mean. You see? - above you see all the files in the directory (in this case ``test-page``) and below it will always render the README.md file. We will make use of this this semester.

``README.md`` file are written in "Markdown" "language". It's a bliss to work with and easy to learn. For now, just get into the habit of including README.md files in your folders in which you describe what the files are about.

Oh, and Atom has a Markdown Preview option that renders markdown for you as you type. Find it at ``Packages>Markdown Preview>Toggle Preview``

Here is a [Markdown Cheatsheet]((https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)).
