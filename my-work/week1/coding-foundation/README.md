## *first assignment: javascript revision*

Little hard for me to recall JS since I haven't been coding for more than half a year!! But got a lot of help from my friends and Leon thank you guys so much ðŸ˜­

Problems encountered:
basic logic of "for loop"
addEventListener
difference between "class" and "id"
dealing with console errors

Hope that I can grab these things again in real quick
